# PIAAC Discovery

This Shiny App is not associated with OECD or PIAAC. All data is available at [https://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/data/](https://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/data/"). Additionally, data has not been weighted for analysis. Any standard errors produced from the data are biased. Please use your judgment when investigating subgroups within and between countries, as sample sizes aren't large enough for accurate conclusions in many cases. In other words, have fun exploring but be cautious in drawing conclusions! The purpose of the app is to guide research interests rather than test hypotheses. See [About PIAAC](https://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/about/) for more information about the survey.
